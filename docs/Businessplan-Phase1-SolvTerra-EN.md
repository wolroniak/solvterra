# 2. Company Objectives and Profile

**Recommended Scope:** 2 pages
**Status:** COMPLETE

## 2.1 Company Objectives

### Vision

**"A world where every person can make a measurable contribution to society with just 5 minutes of their time."**

SolvTerra pursues the vision of fundamentally transforming civic engagement. We believe that the desire to help exists in every person - but traditional volunteering models with rigid time commitments and high coordination effort stand in the way of this desire. Our vision is a society where engagement is as naturally integrated into daily life as checking social media: fast, flexible, measurable, and fulfilling.

### Long-term Company Objectives

SolvTerra has set ambitious but realistic goals to be achieved in three development phases:

**Year 1 (2026) - Market Entry and Validation:**
- 25-30 active NGO partners on the platform
- 2,000-3,000 registered and active students
- 10,000+ successfully completed micro-challenges
- Proof of concept for the platform model

**Year 3 (2028) - Growth and Establishment:**
- Over 100 NGO partners nationwide in Germany
- Over 10,000 active students
- Cost-covering operations through diversified revenue
- Establishment as the leading micro-volunteering platform in Germany

**Year 5 (2030) - Market Leadership and Expansion:**
- Market leader for micro-volunteering in the German-speaking region
- Expansion into the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)
- Break-even achieved, sustainably profitable
- Over 50,000 active users and 500+ NGO partners

### Key Success Factors

The success of SolvTerra depends on five critical factors that we continuously measure and optimize:

**1. User Engagement (Students)**
The platform stands or falls with the active participation of students. We measure success based on the 30-day retention rate (target: >40%), task completion rate (target: >80%), and the proportion of monthly active users (target: >25%). Gamification elements such as points, badges, and leaderboards should reinforce intrinsic motivation.

**2. NGO Satisfaction**
NGOs are our primary customers. We measure their satisfaction through quality ratings of completed tasks (target: >4.0/5), NGO retention rate (target: >80% annually), and recommendation rate. Only when NGOs experience real added value will they use the platform long-term.

**3. Platform Growth**
Organic growth is crucial for achieving network effects. We aim for monthly user growth of 10-15% in the initial phase, with a viral coefficient >1 (each user brings at least one more).

**4. Financial Sustainability**
As a nonprofit organization, SolvTerra must be able to operate long-term without permanent dependency on funding. Critical metrics are Customer Acquisition Cost (target: <€5 per student, <€100 per NGO), Lifetime Value, and a runway of at least 12 months.

**5. Quality of Micro-Tasks**
The quality of completed tasks is essential for trust on both sides. We implement a rating system, spot checks, and quality scores for volunteers.

### Strategy

SolvTerra pursues a **hybrid strategy** that combines nonprofit goals with financial sustainability. The business model develops in three phases:

| Phase | Period | Funding | Sponsored | Premium | Other |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| **1 - Build** | 2026-2027 | 80% | 15% | 5% | - |
| **2 - Growth** | 2027-2028 | 50% | 30% | 15% | 5% |
| **3 - Sustainability** | 2029+ | 20% | 45% | 25% | 10% |

**Legal Form:** SolvTerra will be founded as a **gGmbH (gemeinnützige GmbH / nonprofit limited liability company)** to take advantage of tax benefits and gain access to donations. For commercial activities exceeding the exemption limit of €45,000/year (particularly Sponsored Challenges with branding considerations), a **commercial subsidiary** will be established in the future. This hybrid structure enables maximum flexibility while maintaining nonprofit status.

**Funding Strategy:**
- **Phase 1:** Focus on public funding (EXIST-Gründungsstipendium (EXIST Startup Grant), DSEE (Deutsche Stiftung für Engagement und Ehrenamt / German Foundation for Engagement and Volunteering), Stiftungen (foundations))
- **Phase 2:** Diversification through Sponsored Challenges and first premium customers
- **Phase 3:** Self-sustaining model with reduced funding dependency

## 3.1 Customer Benefits / Customer Value

### Target Groups

SolvTerra operates as a **two-sided marketplace** with two equally critical target groups and a supplementary revenue source:

**NGOs = Primary Customers (B2B)**

NGOs are the paying customers who post challenges and will prospectively pay for premium features.

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Number in Germany | ~600,000 eingetragene Vereine (registered associations) |
| Sweet Spot | Organizations with 10-500 employees |
| Estimated Potential | 15,000-25,000 NGOs with digital needs |
| Core Problem | Many small, important tasks remain undone because traditional volunteering is too time-consuming |

**Students = Primary Users (B2C)**

Students are the users who complete challenges and generate value for NGOs. Without active students, the platform has no value for NGOs - both sides are equally critical for success.

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Number in Germany | ~2.9 million |
| Core Target Group | 18-28 years, Master's students (70% of survey participants) |
| Engagement Status | 54% currently not active, 74% were deterred by time requirements |
| Awareness of Existing Apps | 76% don't know any engagement platforms |

**Corporate Partners = Supplementary Revenue Source (B2B2C)**

Companies are not a primary target group but an additional monetization opportunity from Phase 2.

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Focus | Companies with CSR budget and interest in youth marketing |
| Budget Expectation | 62.5% under €2,000/year (exploratory survey n=8) |
| Main Interest | Brand visibility among young target groups, measurable impact |

### Target Group Needs

**NGOs - Identified Needs:**
- Relief for small, time-intensive tasks (social media, research, event support, etc.)
- Access to flexible, motivated workforce without permanent employment
- Documented impact for funding applications and annual reports
- Young talent acquisition and building a supporter pipeline

**Students - Validated Needs (from survey n=50):**

| Need | Validation |
|------|------------|
| Flexible engagement without long-term commitment | 74% were deterred from engagement by time requirements |
| Meaningful use of small time windows | 64% would perform 2-3 micro-actions per week |
| Visible, verified impact | 72% want before/after data as proof |
| Social component (with friends) | 62% would help more if they could do it with friends |
| Gamification and recognition | 54% find small rewards motivating, 46% badges/certificates |

**Companies - Identified Needs (from survey n=8):**
- Simple onboarding with little administrative effort (top mention)
- Clear visibility and branding opportunities
- Alignment with own CSR goals
- Measurable ROI and impact reports

> **Methodological Note on Survey:** The present survey (n=58) should be understood as an exploratory validation study, not as representative market research. Limitations include: concentration on TU Darmstadt (66% of students), overrepresentation of Master's students (70%), and small sample size for companies (n=8, of which 75% large enterprises). The results validate the core hypotheses qualitatively; quantitative representativeness requires follow-up studies in Phase 1.

### Product Functions and Customer Benefits

**SolvTerra offers three integrated products:**

| Product | Core Function | Primary Benefit |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **NGO Platform (Web)** | Challenge creation, volunteer management, impact dashboard | Efficient task distribution, documented impact |
| **Student App (Mobile)** | Challenge feed, gamification, portfolio | Fast, flexible engagement with recognition |
| **Sponsored Challenges** | Branded CSR campaigns | Brand visibility + measurable societal contribution |

**Micro-Challenge Types:**

| Category | Examples | Duration |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Digital/Remote** | Social media content, translations, online research, data entry | 5-30 min |
| **On-Site** | Distribute flyers, short surveys, event support, create photos | 15-60 min |

**Verification System (Incremental Build-up):**

The verification system is built incrementally to reduce MVP complexity and enable fast market entry:

| Method | Phase | Application | Mechanism |
|--------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| NGO Confirmation | **MVP** | All challenge types | Manual approval by NGO |
| Photo Upload | **MVP** | On-site challenges | Simple upload with timestamp |
| Text Submission | **MVP** | Research, translations | Manual spot check |
| GPS Validation | Phase 2 | On-site challenges | Location verification |
| Screenshot Proof | Phase 2 | Social media, online actions | Link verification |
| AI-powered Analysis | Phase 3 | Scaling | Automatic image/text review |

> **MVP Focus:** The MVP focuses on manual NGO confirmation and simple photo upload. This creates trust without technical complexity. Automated verification (GPS, AI) follows in later phases based on user feedback and scaling needs.

**Gamification System (Data-based Prioritization):**

The gamification strategy is based on survey data and prioritizes elements with positive resonance. Leaderboards are deliberately implemented as opt-in, as 44% of respondents find rankings demotivating.

| Element | Phase | Function | Resonance (Survey) |
|---------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Points (XP) | MVP Basic | Earned per challenge | 32% motivating |
| Badges/Certificates | MVP Basic | Thematic awards for portfolio | **46% motivating** |
| Small Rewards | MVP Basic | Partner discounts, small prizes | **54% motivating** |
| Level System | MVP Full Version | "Starter" to "Impact Champion" | Long-term engagement |
| Streaks | MVP Full Version | Daily/weekly series | Regularity |
| Multi-Person Challenges | MVP Full Version | Challenges for 2+ people together | **62% would help more with friends** |
| Community Feed | MVP Full Version | Networking, exchange, finding challenge partners | Increases time on platform |
| Leaderboards | MVP Full Version | Rankings (visible only on request) | 24% motivating, **44% demotivating** |
| **Impact Wrapped** | Q4 2026 | Annual activity report in Spotify Wrapped style (first Wrapped: end of 2026) | Retention, virality |

**Social Features - Multi-Person Challenges & Community Feed (MVP Full Version):**

The social features address a validated need: **62% of surveyed students would help more if they could do it with friends.** These features increase platform attractiveness and extend time spent on platform.

| Feature | Function | Benefit |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Multi-Person Challenges** | Challenges designed for 2+ people (e.g., distributing flyers together, team research, group actions) | Higher completion rate, mutual motivation, social bonding |
| **Community Feed** | Internal feed in Instagram/LinkedIn style with posts, completed challenges, achievements | Users connect, find challenge partners, share experiences |
| **Challenge Partner Matching** | Function for finding companions for multi-person challenges | Overcomes barrier "nobody to join" |
| **Team Profiles** | Friend groups can see shared impact statistics | Gamification at group level, competition between teams |

> **Strategic Value:** Social features create lock-in effects and increase switching costs. Users who have friends on the platform are significantly less likely to switch.

**Impact Wrapped - Annual Activity Report (Q4 2026):**

Inspired by the success of "Spotify Wrapped," each user receives a personalized, visually appealing report on their engagement activities at the end of the year:

| Content | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Total Impact | Number of completed challenges, invested time, supported NGOs |
| Top Categories | In which areas the user was most active (e.g., environment, social, education) |
| Personal Comparison | Development compared to previous year (from 2027) |
| Highlights | Special challenges, earned badges, milestones |
| Shareable Cards | Graphics for social media (Instagram Stories, LinkedIn, WhatsApp) |

> **Planned Date:** First Impact Wrapped will be rolled out for all users at the end of 2026. Goal is viral spread through sharing on social media.

### Additional Benefits

**For NGOs:**
- **Donor Pipeline:** Engaged students become future donors and supporters
- **Quality Proof:** Verified engagement strengthens credibility with funders
- **Digital Transformation:** Modernization of volunteer coordination

**For Students:**
- **Career Boost:** Documented engagement portfolio for job applications
- **Community & Social Features:** Networking with like-minded people via community feed, multi-person challenges with friends
- **Micro-Learning:** Insights into various NGO areas without long-term commitment
- **Impact Wrapped:** Annual personalized activity report (from Q4 2026) - shareable on social media for viral reach

**For Society:**
- Activation of unused engagement potential (54% of students are not active)
- Contribution to UN SDGs (esp. SDG 10, 11, 17)
- Strengthening of cohesion between generations

### Required Partnerships

| Partner Type | Purpose | Priority |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Hochschulen (Universities)** | Access to students, legitimacy, Gründungszentrum (startup center) | HIGH |
| **Pilot NGOs** | Content for platform, feedback, case studies | HIGH |
| **Dachverbände (Umbrella Organizations)** (e.g., BAGSO, Paritätischer) | Reach to NGOs, recommendations | MEDIUM |
| **Corporate Partners** | Sponsored Challenges, monetization | MEDIUM (Phase 2) |
| **Förderinstitutionen (Funding Institutions)** (EXIST, DSEE) | Financing, network | HIGH |

### Marketplace Sequencing (Chicken-Egg Solution)

As a two-sided marketplace, SolvTerra faces the classic chicken-and-egg problem: NGOs don't post challenges without students, students don't download the app without challenges. The solution is through an **NGO-first strategy**:

1. **Before Public Launch:** Equip 5-10 pilot NGOs with curated challenge templates
2. **Guaranteed Supply:** At least 50 active challenges at launch
3. **University Partnerships:** Guaranteed student base through TU Darmstadt cooperation
4. **Manual Matching:** Active mediation by the team in the initial phase

The detailed strategy is described in Chapter 5 (Marketing).

### Competitive Analysis

The German market for digital engagement platforms is fragmented (15+ providers), but **no platform explicitly focuses on micro-volunteering with gamification and verification**.

**Direct Competitors:**

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses vs. SolvTerra |
|------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **letsact** (150k downloads) | Mobile-first, largest app | No gamification, no verification, no Sponsored Challenges |
| **FlexHero** (160+ municipalities) | B2G network, local marketing | 90% in-person projects, no micro format, no gamification |
| **vostel.de** (60k placements) | Strong filters, international | Web-only, longer commitments, no gamification |
| **GoVolunteer** (120k placements) | Broad spectrum, awards | No micro focus, no integrated gamification |

**Indirect Competitors:**

| Competitor | Focus | SolvTerra Differentiation |
|------------|-------|---------------------------|
| **youvo** | Skill-based for creatives | Time-intensive (10-20h), niche |
| **The Good Ones** | Professional matching | Professionals, not students |
| **SOPS** | Social points system | €5 registration fee, unclear rewards model |
| **Mitwirk-O-Mat** | Quiz matching | One-time use, no direct placement |

**Market Observation: betterplace.org**

betterplace.org, Germany's largest donation platform, **discontinued its Zeitspenden/Ehrenamt (time donation/volunteering) function in June 2022** and has since focused on monetary donations. The withdrawal of an established provider signals both market opportunities (unmet demand) and challenges in the volunteering segment (monetization, critical mass).

**Competitive Matrix:**

| Criterion | SolvTerra | letsact | FlexHero | vostel | youvo |
|-----------|-----------|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| Micro Format (5-30 min) | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Gamification | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Multi-Person Challenges** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Community Feed** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Verification | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ⚠️ |
| Mobile App (MVP Basic) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Sponsored Challenges | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Student Focus | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Impact Wrapped | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**SolvTerra Unique Selling Propositions (USPs):**
1. **First Micro-Volunteering** with explicit 5-30-minute focus in Germany
2. **Integrated Gamification** (points, badges, rewards; leaderboards opt-in; annual "Impact Wrapped")
3. **Multi-Person Challenges** - Challenges that can be completed with 2+ people together increase attractiveness and time spent on platform (validated: 62% would help more if they could do it with friends)
4. **Community Feed** - Internal feed for networking between users, enables exchange, sharing of achievements, and finding challenge partners
5. **Verification System** (NGO confirmation in MVP, later extended)
6. **Sponsored Challenges** as prospective monetization model (Phase 2+)
7. **Student Focus** with mobile-first approach (Mobile App from MVP Basic)

**Honest Assessment of Differentiation:**

The differentiation from letsact is primarily based on product mechanics (gamification, micro format, social features) and target group focus (students). These features are **technically replicable**. The sustainable competitive advantage arises through:
- **Social Lock-in:** Users with friends on the platform switch less often (Multi-Person Challenges, Community Feed)
- Fast community building before competitor reaction
- Exclusive university partnerships
- Accumulated data (which challenges work)
- First-mover advantage in the micro segment
- **Viral Distribution:** Impact Wrapped as annual, shareable content

The risk of competitor imitation is addressed in Chapter 8 (Opportunities and Risks).

**Sponsored Challenges - Validation Status:**

The Sponsored Challenges model is based on an exploratory company survey (n=8). Validation shows fundamental interest with simultaneous price sensitivity (62.5% budget under €2,000/year, willingness to pay 2.25/5). Introduction only occurs in Phase 2 with sufficient platform traction, which allows additional validation time. Fallback: Diversified revenue sources (premium NGOs, funding).

## 3.2 Product/Service Development

### State of Technology

The digital engagement market in Germany shows the following technical landscape:

| Aspect | Market Standard | SolvTerra Approach |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Platform Type** | Web-based marketplaces | Mobile-first app + web dashboard |
| **Matching** | Manual search with filters | Filters + personalized feed (MVP), algorithm (Phase 2) |
| **Verification** | None or manual | NGO confirmation + photo (MVP), GPS/AI (later) |
| **Gamification** | Barely present | Points + badges (MVP), levels + leaderboards (Phase 2) |
| **Impact Measurement** | None or rudimentary | Basic dashboard (MVP), export (Phase 2) |

**Technology Maturity:**
- Mobile apps are still underdeveloped in the volunteering sector (only letsact, FlexHero have native apps)
- Gamification concepts from other industries (fitness, education) are transferable
- Verification technologies (GPS, image analysis) are proven and cost-effectively implementable

### Degree of Innovation

**SolvTerra is innovative in three dimensions:**

**1. Format Innovation:**
The micro-volunteering format (5-30 minutes) does not exist as a dedicated offering in Germany. Existing platforms start at 1-2 hours minimum engagement. 74% of surveyed students were deterred from engagement by exactly this time barrier.

**2. Mechanics Innovation:**
The combination of gamification and verification is new in the nonprofit sector. While fitness apps (Strava), language learning apps (Duolingo), and sustainability apps (JoJo Rewards) use these mechanics, they are missing in volunteering.

**3. Business Model Innovation:**
Sponsored Challenges as monetization are not established in the German engagement market. Most platforms finance themselves through funding, donations, or membership fees.

### Why Does This Product Not Exist Yet?

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Market Focus** | Existing providers emerged from traditional Ehrenamt (volunteering) with long-term commitments |
| **Target Group Understanding** | Gen Z preferences (flexibility, gamification) were not systematically addressed |
| **Technical Complexity** | Verification + gamification + two-sided market requires specific expertise |
| **Business Model Risk** | Sponsored Challenges require critical mass on both target groups |
| **Nonprofit Logic** | Many platforms are nonprofit themselves and innovate more slowly |
