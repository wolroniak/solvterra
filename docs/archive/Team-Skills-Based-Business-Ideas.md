## 🏆 TOP RECOMMENDATION: Retail Execution Intelligence Platform

### **Why This is PERFECT for Your Team**

**It's Mystery Shopping BUT with a Supply Chain + AI Angle**

Instead of generic mystery shopping, you focus on **retail execution verification** - helping CPG brands and retailers ensure products are correctly displayed, stocked, and fresh.

**The Problem:**
CPG brands (Coca-Cola, Unilever, Nestlé) spend millions on retail execution but have **no visibility** into whether:
- Products are properly stocked (out-of-stocks = lost sales)
- Planograms are followed (shelf placement per contract)
- Products are fresh (expiry dates, rotation)
- Promotions are executed correctly
- Competitors are monitored

**Your Solution:**
AI-powered mobile app where students photograph store shelves → AI analyzes:
- Stock levels and out-of-stocks
- Planogram compliance
- Product freshness (expiry dates via OCR)
- Price compliance
- Promotional display quality
- Competitor presence

---

### **How It Leverages YOUR Skills**

✅ **Salma (Supply Chain):** Retail execution IS supply chain - stock management, inventory, logistics
✅ **Jiayi (SAP + Supply Chain):** Could integrate with retail/CPG SAP systems for data flow
✅ **Ron & Nico (AI/GenAI):** Image recognition for shelf analysis, AI categorization
✅ **Chaimae (Marketing):** Building student community, brand partnerships with CPG companies
✅ **Steffi (Strategic PM):** Go-to-market strategy, CPG partnerships, pitch development

---

### **The Market is REAL**

**Image Recognition in CPG Expected to Grow:**
"From USD 1.4 Billion in 2020 to USD 3.7 Billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 21.7%, driven by increased need for successful retail execution and planogram adherence."

**Source:** [ParallelDots - Planogram Compliance](https://www.paralleldots.com/resources/insights/all-about-planogram-compliance-in-retail)

**Leading Platforms:**
- ParallelDots ShelfWatch
- Pepperi
- BSavvy
- GoSpotCheck

**BUT:** These are expensive enterprise solutions. You can target **SME CPG brands** who can't afford ParallelDots but still need retail visibility.

---

### **Business Model**

**Revenue Streams:**

1. **CPG Brand Subscriptions:**
   - €500-€2,000/month per brand
   - Depends on # of stores monitored and frequency
   - Example: Beer brand monitors 50 stores weekly in Bavaria

2. **Per-Store-Visit Pricing:**
   - €10-€20 per store audit
   - Brand purchases credits, uses as needed
   - Student earns €5-€8 per audit

3. **Competitor Intelligence:**
   - Premium add-on: competitive shelf analysis
   - Which competitors are present, pricing, promotions
   - €1,000-€3,000/month for competitive intelligence package

4. **Data Analytics Dashboard:**
   - SaaS platform showing trends, insights, anomalies
   - Real-time alerts (out-of-stock, price violations)
   - Integration with CPG ERP/SAP systems

**Student Economics:**
- €5-€8 per store visit (10-15 minutes)
- 4-6 stores per hour = €20-€48/hour effective rate
- Flexible, app-based, done while shopping

---

### **Weak but Defensible SDG Connection**

**SDG 12.3:** "By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at retail and consumer levels"

**How You Contribute:**
- **Better inventory management** → Reduces out-of-stocks AND overstocking
- **Expiry date monitoring** → Flags products near expiry so they can be discounted/sold
- **Rotation verification** → Ensures FIFO (first-in-first-out) reducing spoilage

**For Professors:**
"We address SDG 12.3 (reduce food waste) by providing CPG brands and retailers with real-time visibility into stock levels and product freshness. Our AI-powered shelf monitoring helps prevent food waste through:
1. Early detection of near-expiry products
2. Optimal inventory levels (reducing overstocking)
3. First-in-first-out rotation compliance verification

Research shows that better retail execution and inventory management directly reduces food waste at the retail level, a key target of SDG 12.3."

**Additional Weak Connections:**
- **SDG 8 (Decent Work):** Providing flexible, fairly-paid work to students
- **SDG 9 (Industry/Innovation):** Using AI/computer vision for retail innovation
