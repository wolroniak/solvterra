# Interview \- Segelflugverein Riedelbach

## **Interview 1 – Segelflugverein**

**Organization:** Segelflugverein Riedelbach (German gliding club / NGO)  
**Interviewee Role:** Werkstattleiter (Head of Technical Maintenance), member of the extended board

**Key Insights:** The NGO is currently dissatisfied with its volunteer capacity, but volunteer coordination effort is relatively low and volunteers are generally reliable. Most volunteer tasks are highly specialized, safety-critical, and require prior knowledge, which limits their suitability for micro-volunteering. While short and modular tasks exist, operational and technical activities are constrained by insurance and qualification requirements. Digital tools are not currently used for volunteer recruitment, as volunteers typically join through intrinsic interest rather than platforms. The strongest perceived value of a micro-volunteering platform lies in increased visibility and youth engagement, not in solving operational staffing issues. Realistic use cases are limited to non-operational tasks such as marketing and event organization. The NGO is open to piloting the concept under low-risk conditions and expects a freemium model with essential features available at no cost.

## **2\. Micro-Volunteering: Pain Points and Friction**

**Answer:**  
In some cases, it is difficult to find volunteers because people may not like the task, lack the required equipment, or do not have the necessary skill set.

# Interview \- Sport & Kulturverein

## **Interview 2 – Sport- und Kultureverein**

**Organization:** Sport- und Kulturverein (local sports and culture NGO)  
**Interviewee Role:** Board Member – *Schriftführer* (Secretary of the Association)

**Key Insights:** The NGO is currently dissatisfied with its volunteer capacity and struggles not only to recruit helping volunteers but also board members. Volunteer coordination requires ongoing administrative effort, and volunteer reliability is a challenge, with occasional lateness and no-shows leading to increased time pressure and stress. Volunteer work is primarily event-based and seasonal, with tasks typically requiring several hours rather than very short micro-tasks. Digital platforms are not currently used for volunteer recruitment or coordination. The strongest perceived value of a micro-volunteering platform lies in faster and easier access to volunteers for time-sensitive, event-related activities rather than long-term volunteer management. Realistic use cases include event setup tasks such as building stages, setting up market stalls, and forming event teams. The NGO is open to piloting the concept, provided that task creation and registration are extremely easy, time-efficient, and supported by a functional MVP with visible volunteer interest.

## **Opening and Framing**

### **Q1: Can you briefly describe your NGO and current volunteer activities?**

**Answer:**  
 We are a small Sport- und Kulturverein with five active members. Our main activities focus on organizing community events, such as the annual Christmas market. Volunteer work is primarily related to planning and executing these events.

### **Q2: Roughly how many volunteers do you work with in a typical month?**

**Answer:**  
 We mainly collaborate with other organizations and NGOs. Across the year, we work with around eight to nine partner organizations. These partners provide both resources and volunteers, as they often have between 100 and up to 1,000 members.

## **1\. Current Reality – How Volunteering Works Today**

### **Q3: Are you currently struggling to find volunteers?**

 Yes, we are struggling to find volunteers, not only for helping with activities but also for board positions.

### **Q4: Are you satisfied with the number of volunteers you have?**

**Answer:**  
 No.

### **Q5: What kind of volunteer activities do you typically offer?**

**Answer:**  
 Our volunteer activities mainly involve planning and organizing sporting events and community markets.

### **Q6: Do you currently have tasks that can be completed in under one hour, or do you struggle to modularize your volunteer work?**

**Answer:**

## **2\. Micro-Volunteering – Pain Points and Friction**

### **Q8: When you need volunteers quickly, what usually goes wrong?**

**Answer:**  
 Volunteers are sometimes late, there is a lack of consistency, and occasionally there is a mismatch between the volunteers’ skills and the task requirements.

### **Q9: How often do people sign up but then don’t show up, and what are your solutions?**

**Answer:**  
 This happens in roughly 10% of cases. When it does, the tasks are redistributed among the remaining volunteers, which means the work takes longer.

### **Q10: What is the impact in terms of time, stress, money, service, or quality?**

**Answer:**  
 The main impact is increased time pressure and stress for the people involved.

### **Q11: Have you tried using any platforms or tools before? What didn’t work well?**

**Answer:**  
 No, we have not used any digital platforms or tools for volunteer coordination so far.

## **3\. SolveTerra – Concept Reaction**

### **Q12: Which benefits of the concept would be most valuable for you?**

**Answer:**  
 Greater visibility and easier access to volunteers.

### **Q13: What part of this sounds useful, if any?**

**Answer:**  
 Access to volunteers who can help with time-sensitive activities, such as setting up market stalls or stages shortly before an event.

### **Q14: What sounds unnecessary or risky?**

**Answer:**  
 There are no specific risks, but it is very important that registration is easy and fast. Ideally, volunteers should not need to create a new account, but be able to sign up using an existing tool such as a Google Form or their Google account.

### **Q15: In which situations would you realistically use something like this?**

**Answer:**  
 Primarily for event-based activities, especially event setup tasks such as building stages or preparing infrastructure.

**Answer:**  
 A long or complicated setup process and the need to invest too much time in learning or managing the tool.

---

## **6\. Letter of Intent**

### **Q22: What would be needed for you to sign up for a pilot?**

**Answer:**  
 A clearly defined concept, a working MVP, and proof of volunteer interest, as well as an initial proof of concept.

# Feedback on MVP

## **Feedback 1 \- Sport & Kulturverein**

The MVP relies heavily on an iOS-style interface. This assumes iOS usage across users, which may not be realistic, particularly in NGO or professional contexts where Windows-based systems are common. A more platform-agnostic or Windows-oriented approach would be more appropriate.

The concept is built around gamification using Experience Points (XP). Based on the NGO interviews, there is no clear need for XP from the NGO perspective. The gamified element appears unnecessary, and its relevance to the core value of the product is unclear. This aspect should be reconsidered or more clearly justified.

Overall, the interface is clean, well-structured, and easy to navigate, which is a strong positive aspect of the MVP.
