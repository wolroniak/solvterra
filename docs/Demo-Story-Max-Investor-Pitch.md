## Part 1: Meet Max - The Pain Points

### The Persona: "Der Zeitknappe" (The Time-Pressed)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Max Mustermann |
| **Age** | 24 |
| **Status** | Master's student, Business Informatics (Wirtschaftsinformatik) |
| **University** | TU Darmstadt |
| **Work** | 15h/week working student job |
| **Device** | iPhone, always on the go |
| **Location** | Darmstadt/Frankfurt Rhine-Main area |

### Max's Bio (as shown in app)
> "Master Wirtschaftsinformatik @ TU Darmstadt | 15h Werkstudent | Helfe in kleinen Zeitfenstern 🌱"

### The Problem Max Faces

**Survey validation (n=50 students):**
- 54% of students are NOT actively volunteering
- 74% were deterred from engagement by time requirements
- 76% don't know any engagement platforms

**Max's internal monologue (based on PRD persona):**

> *"I genuinely want to help. I see the problems in society - food waste, environmental issues, lonely seniors. But my schedule is brutal. Between lectures, my working student job, and studying for exams, I have maybe 30 minutes here and there. Every time I've looked into volunteering, it's 'commit to every Tuesday evening' or 'minimum 4-hour shifts.' I can't do that. And it makes me feel guilty."*

**The quote that defines Max:**
> "I want to help, but I can't commit to every Tuesday at 6pm. If I could help for 10 minutes on the train, I would."

### The Critical Gap

| Traditional Volunteering | Max's Reality |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| Fixed weekly schedules | Unpredictable study/work load |
| Minimum 2-4 hour commitments | 15-30 minute windows between activities |
| Long onboarding processes | Wants to start immediately |
| No tangible recognition | Needs portfolio for job applications |
| No flexibility | Life is already overwhelming |

**This is the gap SolvTerra fills.**

## Part 2: The Discovery - Finding SolvTerra

### Onboarding (November 1, 2025)

Max discovers SolvTerra through a poster at the TU Darmstadt Career Center. The tagline catches his eye:

> **"Micro-Volunteering für Studierende - 5-30 Minuten, die die Welt verändern"**

He downloads the app and completes registration:
1. Signs up with university email: `max.mustermann@student.tu-darmstadt.de`
2. Quick 3-screen tutorial (< 2 minutes)
3. Selects interests: **Environment**, **Education**, **Health**
4. Sees his first personalized challenge feed

**Key UX principle:** Time to first value < 5 minutes

---

## Part 3: The Journey - From Starter to Helper

### Week 1: First Challenge (November 5, 2025)

Max sees a challenge in his feed that fits his 15-minute lunch break:

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Organization | NABU Ortsgruppe Darmstadt |

- Receives **+10 XP**
- Earns badge: **"Erste Schritte" (First Steps)** 🌱
- Sees animated celebration

**Max's reaction:** *"Wait, that was it? 5 minutes and I actually contributed to environmental research? And I got recognition for it?"*

### Weeks 2-3: Building Momentum

**Max's transformation:** *"I'm using time I used to spend scrolling Instagram. Between lectures, waiting for the train, my coffee break - these are perfect micro-volunteering windows."*

### Week 4: The Breakthrough - On-Site Engagement

## Part 6: The Transformation - Before & After

| Volunteering | 0 hours/month |

| Social impact | None documented |
| Community | Isolated, no engagement network |
| CV social section | Empty |

### After 5 Weeks with SolvTerra

| Aspect | Max's Situation |
|--------|----------------|

### Max's Testimonial (for investor pitch)

> *"Before SolvTerra, volunteering felt impossible with my schedule. Now I've helped five different organizations in my spare moments - on the train, between lectures, during coffee breaks. The Tafel experience was incredible. I sorted food that feeds families, and it only took 30 minutes. The gamification keeps me engaged - I'm working toward my next badge. This is exactly what my generation needs."*

## Part 9: Presentation Script for Investors

### 3-Minute Demo Narrative

**[Screen: Max's Profile]**

> "Meet Max. He's a 24-year-old Business Informatics Master's student at TU Darmstadt. He works 15 hours a week as a working student. He wants to volunteer - but with his schedule, traditional volunteering doesn't work."

**[Screen: Challenge Feed]**

> "Max discovered SolvTerra and immediately found challenges that fit his life. 5 minutes here, 10 minutes there. In the first week, he completed an environmental survey during his coffee break and earned his first badge."

**[Screen: Community Feed - Tafel Post]**

> "Then he saw this post from Tafel Rhein-Main - they needed help sorting food during the busy pre-Christmas season. The challenge? Just 30 minutes."

**[Screen: Challenge Detail - Lebensmittel sortieren]**

> "Max saw clear instructions, flexible time slots, and the exact location. He saved it, found a slot that worked, and went."

**[Screen: Submission Photo]**

> "He sorted 50 kilograms of vegetables that now feed families in need. He took a photo, submitted it, and within hours received 50 XP and a 5-star rating from the NGO."

**[Screen: Profile with Badges]**

> "Today, Max has completed 12 challenges, earned 4 badges, supported 5 NGOs, and contributed 3.5 hours - all in time windows he didn't know he had. He's Level 2, working toward Level 3."

**[Screen: Impact Stats]**

> "This is the transformation SolvTerra enables. From zero volunteering to measurable impact. From guilt about not helping to pride in contributing. From an empty CV to a documented engagement portfolio."

**[Close]**

> "Max represents 54% of German students who aren't volunteering - not because they don't want to, but because the current system doesn't fit their lives. SolvTerra changes that."
