SolvTerra Pitch - Speaker Notes for Actors

Total Duration: ~7 minutes (Introduction + Demo + Recap)

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INTRODUCTION SLIDES

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Slide 1: Title Slide [0:00 - 0:05]

On Screen: SolvTerra Logo + "Turning Intention into Action"

RON
[Don't speak yet. Let the slide settle. Make eye contact with jury. Take a breath, then begin.]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Slide 2: The Paradox [0:05 - 0:20]

On Screen: "70% want to volunteer / 70% can't because of time / 2.9 MILLION STUDENTS stuck"

RON
"70% of students want to volunteer. 70% say they can't because of time. That's 2.9 million people in Germany stuck between intention and action."

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Slide 3: Meet the Three Sides [0:20 - 1:00] — LIVE PERSONA DELIVERY

On Screen: Three persona cards with photos (Nico, Steffi, Chuong) — names and roles visible, quotes delivered LIVE

RON
"Meet the three sides of this problem."

NICO
[Steps forward, gestures to his card]
"I want to help - but I can't commit to fixed schedules."

STEFFI
[Steps forward, gestures to her card]
"We need volunteers - but we can't reach students."

CHUONG
[Steps forward, gestures to his card]
"We want to connect with young people and support local causes - but our small team can't run big campaigns. Is there a solution?"

RON
"Yes. SolvTerra connects them."

[Each person speaks for ~5-7 seconds. Brief pause between each speaker for impact. Ron's "Yes. SolvTerra connects them." is the payoff.]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Slide 4: The Question [1:00 - 1:15]

On Screen: "Why does doing good require such a big commitment?"

RON
"Nico can't commit to 4-hour volunteer shifts. Steffi's NGO can't digitize fast enough. And companies? They want to show they care, but a press release about a charity donation doesn't move anyone. They need real stories from real people."

"We asked: why does helping others require such a big commitment? Why can't doing good be as easy as checking your phone?"

"That's why we built SolvTerra."

[Pause after "SolvTerra" — let the name land]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Slide 5: Our Solution - SolvTerra [1:15 - 1:45]

On Screen: Three columns: STUDENTS / NGOs / COMPANIES with bullet points

RON
"SolvTerra is a micro-volunteering platform. Students like Nico complete bite-sized tasks in 5 to 30 minutes and earn XP. NGOs like Steffi's Tierheim get reliable help, reach more people, and skip the administrative burden. And companies can sponsor challenges for authentic, verified CSR impact."

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Slide 6: Our Vision [1:45 - 2:00]

On Screen: "A world where every person can make a measurable contribution to society with just 5 minutes of their time."

RON
"Our vision: A world where every person can make a measurable contribution to society with just 5 minutes of their time."

[Pause for 2 seconds — let it land]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Slide 7: Demo Transition [2:00 - 2:10]

On Screen: "Let us show you how it works." + device icons

RON
"Now let us show you how this actually works. Nico and Steffi are here to demonstrate - live, right now. And you might just become part of the story."
