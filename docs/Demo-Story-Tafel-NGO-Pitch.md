## Part 1: Meet Michael - The NGO Pain Points

### The Persona: "Die mittlere NGO" (The Mid-Size NGO)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Organization** | Tafel Rhein-Main e.V. |
| **Type** | Regional welfare organization |
| **Size** | 25 paid staff, 150+ regular volunteers |
| **Role** | Michael Helfer, Ehrenamtskoordinator (Volunteer Coordinator) |
| **Mission** | "Lebensmittel retten. Menschen helfen." |
| **Coverage** | Rhein-Main region, serving 15,000+ people in need |

### Organization Profile (as shown in dashboard)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | Tafel Rhein-Main e.V. |
| **Category** | Soziales (Social) |
| **Rating** | 4.9/5 (456 reviews) |
| **Verified** | Yes (blue checkmark) |
| **Contact** | kontakt@tafel-rheinmain.de |
| **Website** | https://tafel-rheinmain.de |

### The Problem Michael Faces

**NGO Survey validation (PRD):**
> "We have dozens of small tasks every week that our regular volunteers don't have time for. We need flexible help on demand."

**Michael's internal monologue (based on PRD persona N2):**

> *"Every day, I see 50-100 kilograms of donated food that needs sorting. Our regular volunteers come on fixed schedules - Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. But donations arrive every day. I've tried recruiting more volunteers, but the traditional approach doesn't work anymore.*
>
> *Young people want to help, I know they do. But when I tell them 'commit to every Tuesday at 3pm for the next 6 months,' their eyes glaze over. I've lost count of how many enthusiastic students never showed up after the first week.*
>
> *And the worst part? I spend 10+ hours per week just on volunteer coordination - scheduling, follow-ups, no-shows. That's time I could spend actually helping people.*
>
> *What I need is simple: motivated helpers who can come for 30 minutes, do meaningful work, and leave. No long-term commitment, no complicated scheduling. Just... help when I need it."*

### The Critical Gap

| Traditional Volunteering | Tafel's Reality |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Fixed weekly schedules | Daily fluctuating need |
| Minimum 4-hour shifts | Tasks take 15-30 minutes |
| Long onboarding process | Need help immediately |
| High recruitment cost (€50-100/volunteer) | Limited budget |
| No quality tracking | Need accountability for funders |
| Aging volunteer base | Need young supporters |

**This is the gap SolvTerra fills.**

---

## Part 2: The Discovery - Finding SolvTerra

### Onboarding (October 15, 2025)

Michael discovers SolvTerra through a presentation at the Hessischer Wohlfahrtsverband conference. The pitch catches his attention:

> **"Micro-Volunteering für NGOs - Flexible Helfer in 5-30 Minuten, verifiziert und messbar"**

He registers Tafel Rhein-Main e.V. the same day:

1. Signs up with organization email: `kontakt@tafel-rheinmain.de`
2. Completes organization verification (domain email match)
3. Uploads logo and fills organization profile
4. Explores challenge templates
5. Creates first challenge within 15 minutes

**Key UX principle for NGOs:** Time to first challenge < 15 minutes

### Week 5: The Breakthrough - Max's Submission

On November 22, Michael receives a submission that perfectly demonstrates the platform's value:

---

**SUBMISSION REVIEW PANEL**

**Student:** Max Mustermann (Helper Level)
**Challenge:** Lebensmittel sortieren bei der Tafel
**Submitted:** November 22, 2025, 12:15

**Proof (Photo):**
[Image showing sorted vegetables in crates, with quality organization visible]

**Caption:**
> "Schnelle 30 Minuten in der Mittagspause! Über 50 kg Gemüse sortiert. Das Team bei der Tafel ist super organisiert."

---

**Why This Submission Matters:**

Michael recognizes Max as the student who:
- Arrived exactly on time during the 9-12 Uhr slot
- Asked good questions about the sorting system
- Worked efficiently for exactly 30 minutes
- Left with a smile, saying he'd be back

**Michael's Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Feedback:** "Tolle Arbeit! Der Park sieht jetzt viel besser aus. Danke fürs Mitmachen!"

This is the **same Max** from the student journey document - both perspectives tell one connected story.

## Part 6: The Transformation - Before & After

### Before SolvTerra

| Aspect | Michael's Situation |
|--------|---------------------|
| Volunteer recruitment | 10+ hours/week, €50-100 per volunteer |
| Young volunteers | Near zero - couldn't meet time requirements |
| Task completion | Unpredictable, many no-shows |
| Quality tracking | Manual spreadsheets, no verification |
| Funder reporting | Time-consuming, lacking concrete data |
| Donor pipeline | No system for converting volunteers |

### After 5 Weeks with SolvTerra

| Aspect | Michael's Situation |
|--------|---------------------|
| Volunteer recruitment | 2 hours/week, €0 per volunteer |
| Young volunteers | 167 participants, 70% students |
| Task completion | 87% completion rate, photo-verified |
| Quality tracking | Automated dashboard, 4.9/5 rating |
| Funder reporting | One-click export, visual charts |
| Donor pipeline | Engaged students for future campaigns |

### Michael's Testimonial (for investor pitch)

> *"Before SolvTerra, I spent half my week coordinating volunteers who often didn't show up. Now I post a challenge in 5 minutes, and motivated students come when it works for them.*
>
> *The verification system gives me peace of mind - I can see exactly what was done. And the dashboard? When our funders ask about volunteer engagement, I just export the report. No more scrambling for numbers.*
>
> *Last week, Max - a student from TU Darmstadt - sorted 50 kg of vegetables in his lunch break. He was efficient, professional, and left with a smile. That's the future of volunteering.*
>
> *We've had 167 participants in 5 weeks. Zero recruitment cost. This is exactly what NGOs like us need."*
>

## Part 8: Business Impact - What This Demo Proves

### For Investors: Key Metrics Validated (NGO Side)

| KPI | Target (PRD) | Tafel's Journey |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| Time to first challenge | <15 min | 12 min |
| Challenge creation rate | 5+/month | 5 in 5 weeks |
| NGO retention (projected) | >80% annually | Active, engaged |
| NGO satisfaction | >4.0/5 | 4.9/5 received rating |
| Submission approval rate | >80% | 87% |

### The Unit Economics Story (NGO Side)

**Traditional Volunteer Recruitment:**
- Recruitment cost per volunteer: €50-100
- Average hours to onboard: 5-10
- No-show rate: 30-40%
- Quality verification: Manual/none

**With SolvTerra:**
- Recruitment cost per volunteer: €0
- Onboarding time: Self-service (0 hours)
- Completion rate: 87%
- Quality verification: Photo + Rating system

**ROI for Tafel:**
- 167 participants × €75 avg recruitment cost = **€12,525 saved**
- 10 hours/week saved on coordination = **40+ hours/month**
- Export-ready impact reports for funders = **Priceless**

### Why Tafel Is the Perfect Demo NGO

1. **High emotional resonance:** Fighting food waste, feeding families
2. **Clear tangible impact:** "50 kg food sorted" is concrete
3. **Mid-Size NGO (N2):** Our PRIMARY target segment
4. **Recurring need:** Daily volunteer demand validates model
5. **Connected story:** Max's submission creates cross-demo alignment
6. **Scalable:** Every Tafel in Germany has identical needs

## Part 11: Presentation Script for Investors

### 3-Minute Demo Narrative (NGO Perspective)

**[Screen: NGO Dashboard - Home]**

> "Now let's see the other side of SolvTerra. Meet Michael Helfer, volunteer coordinator at Tafel Rhein-Main. Every day, donated food arrives that needs sorting. His regular volunteers can't keep up."

**[Screen: Challenge Creation]**

> "Michael posts a simple challenge: 'Sort food for 30 minutes.' He sets the location, schedule, and verification method. It takes him 5 minutes."

**[Screen: Submissions Queue]**

> "Within days, submissions start arriving. Students like Max show up, do the work, and upload proof. Michael reviews each one with a simple approve/reject."

**[Screen: Max's Submission]**

> "Look - here's Max's submission from last week. '50 kg vegetables sorted in my lunch break.' Michael gives him 5 stars. Both sides are happy."

**[Screen: Dashboard Stats]**

> "The results? 167 participants. 42.5 volunteer hours. 87% approval rate. Zero recruitment cost. All tracked, all verified, all exportable for funders."

**[Screen: Impact Export]**

> "When Tafel's funders ask about volunteer engagement, Michael clicks 'Export' and sends a professional PDF report. No more scrambling for data."

**[Close]**

> "This is why NGOs will pay for SolvTerra. Not because we ask them to - because we solve their biggest problem. Michael saves 8+ hours per week and gets better volunteers than ever before. That's the B2B value proposition."
